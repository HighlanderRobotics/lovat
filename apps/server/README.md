# Lovat Server

The Server is Lovat's Express and Prisma backend for authentication, report storage, event-data imports, caching, and analysis.

Return to the [monorepo README](../../README.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.20.0
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

`npm ci` also installs and builds the local `@lovat/db` package from its own lockfile. Keep the full monorepo checkout available. `npm run build` regenerates its client before compiling the server.

Fill the local `.env` without committing it. PostgreSQL and Redis are required to start the service; external integrations are optional only when the exercised code path permits.

## Checks

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
```

`npm test` currently verifies TypeScript compilation rather than behavioral coverage.

## Optional database restore

For realistic local testing, an authorized maintainer may provide a sanitized PostgreSQL dump. Verify the destination connection before running a destructive restore.

```bash
pg_restore -d "postgresql://YOUR_LOCAL_CONNECTION" /path/to/backup.dump \
  --clean --if-exists --no-owner
```

Never restore a dump into an unverified database or commit a dump to this repository.

## Database and deployment

The canonical schema and migrations are in [`packages/db`](../../packages/db). Prisma is pinned to 7.10.0. Run `npm run db:seed` explicitly from this app when needed; seeding is not automatic.

Railway must use the repository root and `Dockerfile.server` so the shared package is included. See the [shared package deployment checklist](../../packages/db/README.md) before enabling migrations.
